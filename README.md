## Troubleshooting issues

"Failed to load image: "Image_name.png"" Error happens when you dont have the required PNG's in the same folder as the EXE
"Antivirus tweaking out help me!!!" untweak it out and let it allow the calc, this is not punjabi evil huggy wuggy virus

## Usage and Notes

Right Mouse Click to set your position
Left Mouse Click to set your target position (the position where you wanna shoot at)
The Elevation will give you 2 values, First one is Low arc and the second one is High arc, This is extremely helpful because you can't hit school with low arc.
The compass on the map isnt accurate to the one ingame (!!!REMEMBER THAT!!!)
Eyeball the Azimuth(direction) of the target
When you are unsure if your elevation gonna hit whilst being on a slope, get an online protractor and do some math, Here is a very reliable and fast one you just snip your artillery's gun and check the angle https://www.ginifab.com/feeds/angle_measurement/
